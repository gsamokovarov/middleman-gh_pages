# Middleman::GhPages

Middleman deploy to GitHub that just works.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'middleman-gh_pages'
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install middleman-gh_pages
```

## Usage

Add the following to your middleman `config.rb` file:

```ruby
activate :gh_pages do |gh_pages|
  gh_pages.remote = 'git@github.com:an_absolute/github_remote_name.git'
end
```

Adding an absolute remote name is a requirement, so we don't have to infer
where to deploy to.

The deploy is always one commit that is forced pushed into the `gh-pages` branch.
You'll never run into merge conflicts, or an unemployable state. You can deploy
anything, as long as you can force push to `gh-pages`.

You can also deploy uncommitted changes as a new deploy commit is created on
every run of:

```
$ middleman gh_pages
```

Hooray! ðŸŽ‰

If you need to push to different branch than `gh-pages` you can specify that with:

```ruby
activate :gh_pages do |gh_pages|
  gh_pages.remote = 'git@github.com:an_absolute/github_remote_name.git'
  gh_pages.branch = 'master'
end
```
